1.generate new keys by 
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@youremail1.com"
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@youremail2.com"

2.add the public key (.pub) file to the github remote ssh key

3.add the keys to the keyring
ssh-add id_rsa1
ssh-add id_rsa2

4.check the keys
ssh-add -l


5.add the config to .ssh/config
#activehacker account
Host acc1
	HostName github.com
	User git
	IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_activehacker
	IdentitiesOnly yes
#jexchan account
Host acc2
	HostName github.com
	User git
	IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_jexchan
	IdentitiesOnly yes
the imp point here is 
acc1 -> git@github.com with identity of 1nd key
acc2 -> git@github.com with identity of 2nd key

now
git clone acc2:any_private_repo.git
will work

6. verify with
ssh -T acc1
ssh -T acc2
